This program was created to help OPENSIS-CE users perform a bulk upload of students.  It utilizes a csv file created by the user and then uploads the data into the correct opensis database tables.  Use will require knowledge of the opensis mysql database credentials, some comfort in modifying files (both csv and the php config.php file) whether using a program or terminal.  Also comfortable installing php files onto the server hosting your OPENSIS instance.  

!!!  ABOVE ALL -- ALWAYS MAKE SURE YOU BACK UP YOUR CURRENT OPENSIS DATABASE BEFORE ANY ACTION IS TAKEN.  Make sure you are comfortable creating the mysql database backup and restoring the data.
